## Hey there ðŸ‘‹ 

I am Ayush and I am currently working at Asians Group as a full stack developer. 

We build high performance CDNs here, at Asians Group, feel free to reach out to us for support - [here](https://www.asians.group/). Our product offers DNS & domain management, web cecurity against cyber attacks, certificate management, in-depth traffic analytics, advanced cache generation and management and much more - in vastly automated mechanisms.

When I'm not immersed in my work, you can find me studying foreign languages, ricing my linux os, working out or reading about religions and mythologies.
