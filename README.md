## Hey there ðŸ‘‹ 

I am Ayush and I am currently working at Asians Group as a full stack developer. 

We build high performance CDNs here, at Asians Group, feel free to reach out to us for support - [here](https://www.asians.group/). Our product offers DNS & domain management, web security against cyber attacks, certificate management, in-depth traffic analytics, advanced cache generation and management and much more - in vastly automated mechanisms.

When I'm not immersed in my work, you can find me studying foreign languages, ricing my linux os, working out or reading about religions and mythologies.

Here's my latest arch linux ricing:
